    + 'Now in quarantine I\'ve been revisiting my past obsession with the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III - '
    + 'watching Twitch streams of pro players, and climbing the ladder one skirmish at at time.',
    'If you\'re more interested in my technical side-projects, check out the dedicated file-dialogs '
