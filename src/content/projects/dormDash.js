    'Because space in university dining halls is anticipated to be restricted in fall 2020 '
    + 'to adhere to COVID-19 safety guidelines, large groups of students should avoid crowding the '
    + 'entrance of the dining hall and increase risk. Our solution is a dining queue, '
    + 'where students can join the queue remotely from their dorm and be notified when thereâ€™s a spot for them '
    + 'to safely come and eat.',
    'I connected Frontend to Backend REST endpoints on Serverless framework with fetch API calls, '
    + 'collected Frontend user information to send to the Backend OAuth as a token, '
    + 'added user interface features for User to queue up, add friends to a party, view '
    + 'status of the processed request, and welcome/exit messages. '
    + 'Additionally, I helped backfill database so my teammate could display weekly queue '
    + 'capacity history on a D3.js barchart. An admin page was also implemented for basic CRUD operations on the AWS database. '
    , 'On the backend, I added endpoints so the frontend could continuously poll if the current user '
    + 'was already added by friends to ultimately maintain coherency for multiple users on the WebApp. ',
